			<h4>Remind yourself why you are doing this!</h4>
			<p>take a moment to remember all the terrible & deadend jobs you've had or are still in! maybe, if you are an artist look again at your bank account and compare to your mountain of debt from art school. remember your dream job vision and keep goin.</p>

			<h4>"I dont know, let's find out"</h4>
			<p>the best phrase I ever learned from a corporate company. "I dont know, let's find out" <br>if you 'dont know', you have the power to figure it out.</p>
